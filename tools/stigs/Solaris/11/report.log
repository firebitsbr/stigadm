  Title: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) must be enabled.
  Description: Modification of memory area can result in executable code vulnerabilities. ASLR can reduce the likelihood of these attacks. ASLR activates the randomization of key areas of the process such as stack, brk-based heap, memory mappings, and so forth.

  Title: The system must implement non-executable program stacks.
  Description: A common type of exploit is the stack buffer overflow. An application receives, from an attacker, more data than it is prepared for and stores this information on its stack, writing beyond the space reserved for it. This can be designed to cause execution of the data written on the stack. One mechanism to mitigate this vulnerability is for the system to not allow the execution of instructions in sections of memory identified as part of the stack.

  Title: The operating system must protect the audit records resulting from non-local accesses to privileged accounts and the execution of privileged functions.
  Description: Protection of audit records and audit data is of critical importance. Care must be taken to ensure privileged users cannot circumvent audit protections put in place. Auditing might not be reliable when performed by an operating system which the user being audited has privileged access to. The privileged user could inhibit auditing or directly modify audit records. To prevent this from occurring, privileged access shall be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with audit-related privileges.

However, if FTP is permitted for use in the environment, it is important to ensure that the default "system" accounts are not permitted to transfer files via FTP, especially the root role. Consider also adding the names of other privileged or shared accounts that may exist on the system such as user "oracle" and the account which the web server process runs under.

  Title: Wireless network adapters must be disabled.
  Description: The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into the organization’s network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point (AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial-of-service to valid network resources.
